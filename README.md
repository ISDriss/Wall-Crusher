## Wall Crusher
Wall crusher is a pygame project.  

The game plays as follows: 
A 3x3 wall is presented to the player with some bricks that are destrucible, others not.   
The player is given a limited time to break all breakable bricks of the wall before being presented with the next wall,  
failing to do so will result in losing a health point.
The player starts with 3 health points.
The goal is to get through as many walls as possible.

Only one game mode is available (endless).  
And a microcontroller can also be connected to navigate the main menu
